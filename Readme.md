# Notes-Taker

Here's a note taking application that has been built using MERN Stack - MongoDB, Expressjs, Reactjs and Nodejs. Apart from this, tailwindCSS has been included in styling. The website consists of pages to add, edit and delete the notes and displays the notes both in tabular as well as grid format. It has a variety of buttons to open a note, read a note, look at it's date and time of creation and updation and delete the note wisefully. This project not only refines one's project implementation skills, but also acts as a revision tool for reactjs including backend.
